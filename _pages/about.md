I am a research scientist in [Dr Tomas Helikar's lab](https://biochem.unl.edu/person/tomas-helikar/) at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. My research interests include developing computational methods which exploit multi-omics datasets to learn the mechanisms of inflammatory and autoimmune disease.  

From Feb 2023 - Dec 2025, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in [Dr Ilya Korsunsky's lab](https://www.korsunskylab.org/) at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. As my primary project, I led spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer to identify and characterize anti-tumor immunity hubs.

From Aug 2017- Jan 2023, I worked on my PhD in Biophysics with [Dr Juilee Thakar](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/thakar.aspx) at the University of Rochester, NY. My graduate work focused on algorithms which use multiomics data to model immune signaling networks in the contexts of health and disease.

I enjoy designing and building open-source software for an audience of both wet & dry lab biologists. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduate students in a laboratory setting, and teaching bioinformatics at the graduate level.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, listening to and playing classical music, reading, art, and exploring the beautiful Massachusetts countryside.
